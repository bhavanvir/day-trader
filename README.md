## 1.0 Product Overview

What is the need for improvement in the client organization?

At Flytographer, we want to optimize the booking process for photo shoots by minimizing the points in which users can cancel a shoot. 

Problems:

- Photographers are forced to block off times while they are waiting for customers to confirm their booking
    
- There are many points in which a booking can fall through on either the customer or the photographer side
    
- Photographers can only provide time they want off rather than specifying when they are available
    
- The photographers currently must book off the morning or afternoon in its entirety if they are not available
    
- A lot of back-and-forth between customer and photographer
    
- No integration with personal calendars
    
- What customer wants is not always what photographer can envision.
    

## 2.0 Project Objectives

Specify the objectives of your project in detail.

50% of customers reach out to the customer help team, this is a number we want to lower. (Reduce customer service inquiries.)

Increase conversion rate of requests into actual bookings.

Lower complexity to book a photoshoot.

Reduce the amount of back-and-forth between customer and photographer.

Enhance clarity of availability calendar for customers.

## 3.0 Current System(s)

- We have currently removed questions asked to customers
    
- There is a maximum time for photographers to respond to customer inquiry (48 hours)
    
- Once a photographer has responded to an inquiry customers have up to 3 days to respond
    
- Photographers manage their availability on a per-city basis
    
- Two time slots per day (morning/afternoon)
    

Current system(s) at the client organization (if any).

Booking Application Interface

The current scheduling system involves two components, namely the scheduling interface and the scheduling workflow. The scheduling interface requires clients to input a destination, date, non-specific time range (either Morning or Afternoon), restrictions, and alternative dates. 

Booking workflow

## 4.0 Intended users of the system

Consider end users both inside the client organization and outside.

The intended users of the system are split between three groups. Contracted photographers who promote their services through the Flytographer booking system may list their availability and communicate with prospective clients. 

- Customers
    
- Customer service
    

## 5.0 Known interaction within or outside the client organization

- Integration with google calendars
    
- Able to copy over their shoots into google calendars
    
- Clients and photographers are connected 3 days before shoot via email
    
- The company tends to decline times outside of sunlight, no bookings inside or in studios
    

## 6.0 Known constraints to development

- Photoshoots must be between sunrise and sunset (no night shoots)
    
- Time zone differences between the booking location and the photoshoot destination must be converted correctly and clearly indicated.
